# Odoo 18 Compliance Report - Manufacturing Material Requisitions Module

## Overview
This report documents all fixes and changes made to ensure the Manufacturing Material Requisitions module is fully compliant with Odoo 18 guidelines.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Security Configuration (security/security.xml)
**Issue**: Invalid Python expressions in domain_force fields
**Fix**: Replaced Python expressions with proper Odoo domain syntax
- Changed `[('department_id', 'in', [d.id for d in user.department_ids])]` to `[('department_id.member_ids.user_id', 'in', [user.id])]`
- Changed `[('work_center_id', 'in', [wc.id for wc in user.workcenter_ids])]` to `[('work_center_id.employee_ids.user_id', 'in', [user.id])]`

### 2. Controller Imports (controllers/__init__.py)
**Issue**: Importing non-existent modules (mobile, portal, webhook)
**Fix**: Removed imports for non-existent controller modules

### 3. Missing Model Fields
**Issue**: View files referenced fields that didn't exist in inherited models
**Fixes**:
- Added `requisition_id` and `requisition_line_id` to `stock.move` model
- Added `requisition_id` to `stock.picking` model
- Added `requisition_line_id` to `purchase.order.line` model
- Added `requisition_ids` and `requisition_count` to `maintenance.equipment` model
- Added `requisition_id` to `maintenance.request` model
- Added `requisition_ids`, `requisition_count`, `auto_requisition_enabled` to `mrp.production` model
- Added `material_requisition_ids` and `is_critical_path` to `mrp.workorder` model
- Added `auto_requisition_enabled` and `requisition_lead_time` to `mrp.bom` model
- Added `default_location_src_id`, `default_location_dest_id`, `department_id` to `mrp.workcenter` model
- Added missing analytics fields to `shop.floor.analytics` model
- Created `manufacturing.mrp.integration` model for MRP dashboard

### 4. Placeholder View Files
**Issue**: Multiple view files contained only placeholder comments
**Fixes**: Created proper view definitions for:
- `mobile_views.xml` - Added mobile-optimized views for shop floor requisitions
- `analytics_views.xml` - Added analytics dashboard and reporting views
- `purchase_integration_views.xml` - Added purchase order integration views
- `inventory_integration_views.xml` - Added inventory and stock integration views
- `requisition_dashboard_views.xml` - Added comprehensive dashboard views
- `quality_requisition_views.xml` - Added quality control integration views
- `maintenance_requisition_views.xml` - Added maintenance equipment integration views
- `mrp_integration_views.xml` - Added MRP production integration views

### 5. Placeholder Wizard View Files
**Issue**: Wizard view files contained only placeholder comments
**Fixes**: Created proper wizard view definitions for:
- `bulk_requisition_wizard_views.xml` - Added bulk requisition creation wizard
- `emergency_requisition_wizard_views.xml` - Added emergency requisition wizard with alerts
- `mrp_requisition_wizard_views.xml` - Added MRP requisition analysis wizard

### 6. Placeholder Report Files
**Issue**: Report template files contained only placeholder comments
**Fixes**: Created proper report templates for:
- `manufacturing_requisition_reports.xml` - Added comprehensive requisition report template
- `analytics_reports.xml` - Added analytics summary report template with wizard

### 7. Placeholder Demo Data Files
**Issue**: Demo data files contained only placeholder comments
**Fixes**: Created comprehensive demo data for:
- `manufacturing_demo.xml` - Added demo requisitions, templates, shifts, and terminals
- `shop_floor_demo.xml` - Added shop floor specific demo data with emergency scenarios

### 8. View Inheritance Issues
**Issue**: Some views tried to inherit from potentially non-existent views
**Fix**: Added proper checks and references to standard Odoo views with fallback handling
